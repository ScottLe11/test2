        <h5>Positive Results</h5>
        <p>Based on the resutls, you do drive a motorized vehicle, and you do have a lot of other energy expenses in your
          life.
          Driving a motoized vehicle will increase green house emissions and using more energy is contributing to the
          use of burning fossil fuels to produce enerfy.

        <h5>Warning</h5>
        <p>If you keep you energy usage habits, you would be doing negligible amount of damage tot he earth.
          But if the majority of people started to copy your habits, it could lead to even more problem than today.
          Like I stated before, issues like raising temperatures, and increased amounts of extreme weather conditoins
          will be more prevalent to the point where people and animals cannot sustain and live on this earth.

        <h5>Improvement Advice</h5>
        <p>You can improve by trying to find alternatives to using a motorized vehicle if you can, like using a bike or using public transportation.
          And there are small things you can do around your house like turning off the lights or air conditioners when they don't need to be used. 
           May little energy spending add up so its important to keep track of these things.
        </p>
        <p>Finally, my last and biggest advice is to spread awareness of this issue and of this advice. In reality, you alone making the good decisions won't be enough to be
        stop, let alone fix the issue of the dangers of climate change. However, if everyone can be aware of the issue and take action together, people's combine efforts will start
        to be seen throughout the world. I hope this website has helped people and I hope you can spread the message as well.
